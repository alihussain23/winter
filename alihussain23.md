Project Name
Summary
What are you going to build? What does it do? Why are you excited to build it?
My plan is to build a external smart door lock that can be controlled using a smart phone app. As pre made interal smart door locks can be quite expensive, and not many external ones exist with limited installation required, im excited to create this project myself 

Plan
What steps are you going to take to build it? What tools are you going to use? What will you do first, second, third, etc.?
First I plan on using 3D printer to building the chassis as well as the locking pins for the lock. The pins will be pushed by a servo and be controlled with a arduino which will be housed inside the chassis. Once all the parts are ordered/created, assembly should be pretty straighforward. Afterwards I plan to create the code for the arduino as well as develop the mobile app through the help of flutter and firebase. 

Budget
